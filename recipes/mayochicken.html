<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This mayo chicken is the perfect dish for those days (or nights) where you want a quick but nutritious meal.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken, cut into 6 pcs</li>
    <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 tbsp finely chopped rosemary</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place chicken pieces into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir together mayonnaise, garlic, rosemary, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Spread mayonnaise mixture over chicken; top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>

</ol>

<p>With that, the chicken is ready! We recommend serving with a side of green leafy vegetables or a salad.</p>
