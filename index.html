<!--Steps to add a git commit message and push a git file to github

1. Decide which file you'd like to add a git commit message to, and push to github.
2. Make a change (ANY change like adding a line, fullstop or others)
  to that particular file. (eg. adding a paragraph to cinnamonrolls.html)

 NOTE: Ensure that the git clone and SSH key steps have already been completed
 at the beginning, when you made your repository.

In the terminal, type in this order: (do not type the $ dollar sign, it is just a prompt)
3. $ git add .        (the "." means add the file I just modified)
4. $ git status       (to check if the file has been moved to staging area)
                      (message appears "modified: recipes/cinnamonrolls.html" in GREEN , for example)
5. $ git commit -m "type a message here"    (use conventional commits for better messages- search up or see in bookmarks)                 
6. $ git push          (pushes the file to github with the git commit message)
7. $ git status        
(to check if the file was successfully committed)
(message appears:"your branch is up to date with origin/main,
 nothing to commit,working tree clean")
DONE!
